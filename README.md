🧮 Graphical Calculator (Processing)

Author: Jacob Ruesch
Date: September 25, 2025

A simple graphical calculator built using the Processing
 environment. This project demonstrates core principles of GUI development, event-driven programming, and object-oriented design using Java-based Processing.

🚀 Features

Graphical User Interface
Custom buttons for digits, operators, and actions with hover effects.

Basic Arithmetic Operations
Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Live Display
Shows the current input or result in a styled display area.

Interactive Button Class
Modular Button class used to manage button behavior and appearance.

🎨 Interface Overview

Number Buttons (0–9)

Operator Buttons: +, -, *, /

Other Buttons:

= — Evaluate the expression

C — Clear (functionality incomplete)

. — Decimal support (partially functional)

±, D — Placeholder for sign toggle and delete (not yet implemented)

📁 Files

Calculator.pde — Main logic and drawing functions

Button.pde — Button class managing rendering and hover logic

You may also combine both into one file if sharing as a single sketch on GitHub or Processing editor.

🛠️ How It Works

Click number buttons to build an operand.

Click an operator (+, -, etc.) to store the first operand.

Click more numbers to build the second operand.

Press = to evaluate and display the result.
